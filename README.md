As a roadtripper who is driving across the country or even just across the state
I want to know the weather at my stops along the way and identify points of interest
So that I can plan my trip and pack accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
```
Given a dashboard with city input and checkboxes to choose points of interest
When I enter a location and select the points of interest I want
